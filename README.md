# AI-Drum-Pattern-Generation (Genre-Specific)
This project generates realistic, genre-specific drum patterns using probabilistic modeling and MIDI data processing. It employs Bayesian inference to learn rhythmic dependencies and patterns from existing drum tracks. The system enables conditional sampling and real-time generation of MIDI drum sequences that reflect the rhythmic characteristics of specific genres such as rock, metal, and jazz.

# Features
Parses and processes MIDI drum files using the Mido and MIDI Library packages.
Utilizes Bayesian Networks to model rhythmic probabilities and transitions.
Supports genre-specific models trained on rock, metal, and jazz drum datasets.
Enables conditional sampling, allowing rhythm generation guided by user-defined constraints.
Provides real-time drum pattern generation for live or adaptive music applications.
Modular design for easy extension to new genres or custom datasets.


# Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Required to run the main scripts.
Mido and MIDI Library: For MIDI file parsing and generation.
NumPy / SciPy: For handling probabilistic computations.
Trained Bayesian Network Models: Genre-specific models for rock, metal, and jazz.
